Galaxy Note i717 (quincyatt) Kexecboot Kernel Builder
-----------------------------------------------------

This repository contains the files required to build a kexec-hardboot supporting kernel with the kexecboot GUI for the Galaxy Note i717.  It builds the kernel and packs an Android-style boot.img with the included ramdisk.  It then packages this boot.img into a flashable zip called kernel_kexecboot.zip which can be flashed to the Note via CWM or TWRP recoveries.  I've included the kernel source as well as the source for my modified version of kexecboot as submodules in this repository.  I am not currently building the kexecboot binary as part of mkbootzip.sh because it must be built for ARM and I don't know how to cross compile it.  If you wish to compile your own kexecboot binary, use an ARM system.  Then copy the compiled binary into the ramdisk/bin directory and run mkbootzip.sh to build a flashable zip containing your custom built kexecboot.  A default binary has been included which does work with the Note if you do not wish to build your own kexecboot binary.
